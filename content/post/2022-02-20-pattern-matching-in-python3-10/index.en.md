## Introduction

[Structural Pattern Matching](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/) is a new feature introduced in python [3.10](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html), and perhaps the most intriguing one.  It takes as input an object to inspect (following `match`), and multiple patterns to match against (following one or more `case`). If there is a match, a pattern-specific code block runs. The basic syntax is 





```python
error_code = 403
match error_code:
    case 400:
        print("Bad request")
    case 403:
        print("Unauthorized")
    case 500:
        print("Internal server error")
    case _:
        print("Something's wrong with the Internet")
#> Unauthorized
```

Here, we check case by case if `error_code` is equal to a value, if it's not one of 400, 403, 500, `_` will be a catch-all wildcard. Also, pattern matching will break when it hits a match, so each `case` should be independent. 



To run examples in this article, be sure you are using python higher than 3.10. To check, use


```python
import sys
sys.version
#> '3.10.2 (main, Feb  2 2022, 05:51:25) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.3)]'
```


## Switch statements 

The most apparent usage of pattern matching is implementing `swich ... case` statements in many other programming languages, which is a replacement for multiple if else statements.  Imagine in some game app we could will have a `move` class method which controls figure movement

```python
def move(self, direction): 
    match direction:
        case "up":
            self.move_up()
        case "down":
            self.move_down()
        case "left":
            self.move_left()
        case "right":
            self.move_right()
```

## Object destructuring 

The real power of pattern matching resides in destructuring data structures like lists and dictionaries. 


```python
match {"first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Doe", "middle_name": ""}:
    case {"first_name": first_name , "last_name": last_name}:
        print(first_name, last_name)
#> Jane Doe
```

In the example above, we supplied a pattern that says the object should contains keys "first_name" and "last_name", if the pattern matches, their values will be captured into the variables `first_name` and `last_name`. Note that for an dictionary, structural pattern matching matches the structure instead of the exact content, the pattern is valid as long as "first_name" and "last_name" exists in the object's keys, and we don't have to worry about the unmentioned "middle_name". 

For a more advanced example, suppose we are working with the [SpaceX API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/) to retrieve launch data, an individual record of launch looks like 

```json
{
        "flight_number": 1,
        "mission_name": "FalconSat",
        "upcoming": false,
        "launch_year": "2006",
        "launch_date_unix": 1143239400,
        "rocket": {
            "rocket_id": "falcon1",
            "rocket_name": "Falcon 1",
        },
        "details": "Engine failure at 33 seconds and loss of vehicle",
        //... other fields
} 
```

We only want to get the fields `mission_name`, `rocket_name` and `details`. Note that



```python
import requests
import json
from pprint import pp
res = requests.get("https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches?limit=3")
data = res.json()
out = []
for launch in data:
    match launch:
        case {"mission_name": mname, "rocket": {"rocket_name": rname}, "details": details}:
            out.append({"mission_name": mname, "rocket_name": rname, "details": details})
            
pp(out)
#> [{'mission_name': 'FalconSat',
#>   'rocket_name': 'Falcon 1',
#>   'details': 'Engine failure at 33 seconds and loss of vehicle'},
#>  {'mission_name': 'DemoSat',
#>   'rocket_name': 'Falcon 1',
#>   'details': 'Successful first stage burn and transition to second stage, '
#>              'maximum altitude 289 km, Premature engine shutdown at T+7 min 30 '
#>              's, Failed to reach orbit, Failed to recover first stage'},
#>  {'mission_name': 'Trailblazer',
#>   'rocket_name': 'Falcon 1',
#>   'details': 'Residual stage 1 thrust led to collision between stage 1 and '
#>              'stage 2'}]
```

Here, not only are we matching top level key `mission_name` and `details`, we also use a nested pattern to extract rocket name. 

List is another common data structure for this sort of extraction. 


```python
match [1, 2, 3]:
    case [1, 2]:
        print("match 1")
    case [2, *rest]:
        print("match 2")
        print(rest)
    case[*other, last]: 
        print("match 3")
        print(last)
        print(other)
#> match 3
#> 3
#> [1, 2]
```

I mentioned that pattern matching for dict does not require use to explicitly declare all fields. For lists this is different, we have to declare all elements, this is why match 1 fails. Match 2 attempts to use the `*` syntax to capture all values after 2 into a list called `rest`. This is helpful in case the list is really large and it's impossible to exhaust all elements, or we simply don't care about some elements. However, the second pattern does not specify the correct order, as 2 is not the first element in the matching object. Match 3 captures all elements but the last into `other`, and assign the last element to `last`. 


It's also possible to do `or` logic with `|` in case statement. For example we may add a `case 401 | 403 | 404: "Not allowed"` statement to our first example. Here is another example from pep: 

```python
match command.split():
    ... # Other cases
    case ["north"] | ["go", "north"]:
        current_room = current_room.neighbor("north")
    case ["get", obj] | ["pick", "up", obj] | ["pick", obj, "up"]:
        ... # Code for picking up the given object
```

Literal patterns can also be captured using the `as` keyword

```python
match command.split():
    case ["go", ("north" | "south" | "east" | "west") as direction]:
        current_room = current_room.neighbor(direction)
```

## Adding conditions 

Pattern matching allows if conditions the same way as list comprehension, we can append a `if ... else` clause like so 


```python
all_directions = ["up", "down"]

match commad.split():
    case ["go", direction] if direction in all_directions:
        move(direction)
    case ["go", _]:
        print("direction not supported")
```


For conditions that checks if an object is of a data type, we can directly use the class creator function:



```python
def sum_list(numbers):
    match numbers:
        case []:
            return 0
        case [int(first) | float(first), *rest]:
            return first + sum_list(rest)
        case _:
            raise ValueError(f"Can only sum lists of numbers, get {_}")
        
sum_list([1, 2, 3])
#> 6
sum_list([1, "2", 3])
#> Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords): ValueError: Can only sum lists of numbers, get __reticulate_placeholder__
#> 
#> Detailed traceback:
#>   File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
#>   File "<string>", line 6, in sum_list
#>   File "<string>", line 8, in sum_list
```

Here `int(first) | float(first)` checks if the first element is an integer or float. The next example uses a `dataclass` based pattern as well as its attributes  


```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float
    y: float

p = Point(x = 1, y = 1)    
# data class for validation
match p:
    case Point(x = x):
        print(x)
#> 1
```


In general, we can use any python class for such validation. This is also called a **class pattern**. 

## Matching constants 

Care should be taken when matching constants, since it's common to store the constant in an variable and then use it in `case`. The next example will not work: 

```python
direction = "up"

match "down":
    case direction:
        print("match")
    case _:
        print("no match")
```

We are trying to match the value "up", but python interprets it as a capture pattern that says store whatever the match object is into the variable `direction`, so we are effectively overriding `direction` (recall the list matching example) and the first case always succeeds. In fact, the code will not run with the error `SyntaxError: name capture 'direction' makes remaining patterns unreachable`. 

We can use a enum type for constant matching instead 


```python
import enum 
class Direction(str, enum.Enum):
    up = "up"
    down = "down"
    
match "down":
    case Direction.up:
        print("match 1")
    case Direction.down:
        print("match 2")
    case _:
        print("match 3")
#> match 2
```
